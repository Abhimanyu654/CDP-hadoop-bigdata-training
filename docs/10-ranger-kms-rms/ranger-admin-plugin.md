# Ranger Admin and Plugins

Ranger Admin is the central policy management interface/service. Service plugins fetch/caches policies and enforce authorization inside supported services; audits record access decisions according to configuration.

## Administrator checklist
- Confirm the role's status and host in Cloudera Manager.
- Check logs, health tests, recent configuration changes, and upstream/downstream dependencies.
- Verify behavior against the exact CDP/Runtime version.
- Capture a sanitized lab example and one failure scenario.

## Interview questions

2. Which components communicate with it?
3. What happens if it becomes unavailable?
4. What metrics/logs would you check first?
